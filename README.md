# Redcode

This project contains an assembler and disassembler for the Redcode assembly language to be used with Core War.

The Redcode variant used in this project is derived from the MIPS instruction set, and includes extended instructions for a distributed version of Core War.

Included with the project is a GUI for testing Redcode assembly and diassembly, as well as a test virtual machine for running Redcode warriors (use at your own peril for it has not been fully fleshed out).
